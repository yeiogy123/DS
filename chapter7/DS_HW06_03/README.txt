In order to implement the merge sorting algorithm, there is a lot of ways to achieve that. Today I must choose the example in the text book to get AC in my homework. As a result, now  I will start to explain the program, which the interative is used.
After input all of the data ito the program. They will be stored into the array first. Next, there is a function called 'merge_sort',which used to cut the array into the same size of array. However, by doing that,each of the same size of the array will start to be sorted ,then , the size of array will be multiply 2 to do more sort util the size of array is reached the original one.Then there is a function called find which is used to find the minimum gap in the sorted array.
