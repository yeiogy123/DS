This program can sort the data which by users entering into the program and finally print out each of the data monement in the array util all of the data is sorted by the number with accessending. The program is using the quick sorting way , which choose the first number as the pivot , after doing that, program will start looking for the data in the array which is smaller than the pivot util it find the position of index of the data which is bigger then the pivot while also there is another variable will find the data which is smaller then the pivot and change them with SWAP function.Util i !< j , the pivot will SWAP with the variable's index data. After doing that, it will print out and do the next recursion with either the pivot index with front and variable-1 or variable +1 with end util the program stopping, all of the data will be sorted.
