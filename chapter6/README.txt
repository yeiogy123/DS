This program can implement the graph by the way of adjentcy lists.	By users entering the numbers of V and E in G(E,V), the program will create a graph with dynamic memorizing declaration way. Next users have to enter the name. After entering that, users have to enter the edges(v1,v2), the program will finally create a graph in indirected graph and use the BellmenFord algorithm to calculate each v to all of the v's least weight. After calculating, the program will verify which of the person have the least of all of the people cost to go to his or her hourse.
