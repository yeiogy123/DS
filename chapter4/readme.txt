This program can input the string. Aftering inputing the string, program will detect the part without the punctuation of string,transforming it into the string without the punctuation and storing it into the list,which is made of a struct list which has char array and a list pointer that can point to the next list. Aftering inputing, all of the list node will be linked to form a linked list . While the next string is inputed, the program will traverse the input without the punctuation in linked list. If it finds that the char array of node is the same to it, it will print out the index that node in the linked list. Otherwise it will make a new node to link the list and  store the input without punctuation in the linked list. Each of the time input find out ,it will output it own ordinary punctuation and output the index followed by it own ordinary input type . the program will stop until the input == eof.
