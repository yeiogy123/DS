This program will built a binary tree by user inputing the number and the coin . Each of the node has the following data: node data, coin data, accelerating coin by the link. After user entering all of the data. The program will run and traverse the program first to find the max accelerating coins of all node in the final node of each link . After running, the program will output the tree with the max coins by the levelorder traversal . When it find out the node has the max accelerating coins, it will follow by the parent link to the root and print the node data .
